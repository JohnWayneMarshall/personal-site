I’m John Marshall, a University of Kentucky graduate with dual B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I’m currently a Junior Developer (Full-Stack / AI) at IYKYKnow AI, where I build lesson-aware, context-gated chatbots and LMS-integrated AI features—shipping hybrid retrieval APIs, prompt-driven quiz engines, and production-ready voice/assistant experiences. I also have hands-on ML project experience, including demand forecasting for Papa John’s. I’m looking for opportunities to ship reliable software and tackle meaningful technical problems.
