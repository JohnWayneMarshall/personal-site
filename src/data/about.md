Welcome to my personal website! I'm John Marshall, a soon-to-be graduate from the University of Kentucky with degrees in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. My academic achievements are supported by a robust technical skill set in programming languages such as Python, C++, and others, along with practical experience from projects like developing a machine learning model for Papa Johns and creating a food ordering web-app. Driven by a passion for technology and innovation, I'm eager to connect and embark on new challenges in the tech world.
